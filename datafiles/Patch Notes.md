    * Ok NOW we have a real modding page up for this game: [Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition | SF1UE | Mods & Resources (gamebanana.com)](https://gamebanana.com/games/19289) We were gonna use mod.io but that didn’t pan out
    * Some more Freakloader changes and fixes: characters now support more sound effects, and bubbles are no longer buggy.

        * New, jazzier title theme!!!
        * Sticky now has his own theme which plays in some of the new cutscenes

* V3.0.2 – August 30th, 2024

    * New and updated music tracks!
        * Flowery Secret now has its own theme

        * Main Menu and Francis’s theme have been updated
    * Bug fixes:
        * The bug I accidentally introduced where you can’t back out of a menu while hovering over a blacked out menu option is fixed. This was, uh, pretty bad, so thank JorJoe05 for coming up with the absolute quickest and funniest fix for something I thought would take literally forever to fix!
    * Other nice things:
        * Backend thing for future stuff: [Input (the excellent Game Maker control library by Juju Adams and Alynne)](https://github.com/offalynne/Input) was originally a very outdated version and has been updated to the most recent version as of today, 8.0.1.
        * Star Arrows now have a fun little Geometry Dash inspired animation when hitting them. This and several other things done for 3.0.3 have been done by JorJoe05. Thanks Jordan!!
        * Playful Park’s tileset has been touched up a bit
        * You can now return to the title from the main menu
* V3.0.4 - April 10th, 2025
    * Two metric tons of performance improvements thanks to JorJoe05!
        * Every bit of graphics interpolation I missed has been touched up. Play above 60fps now for a treat!
        * Loading times have been massively sped up. They weren't bad before but now they're insanely fast!
    * Two cutscenes redone to improve flow
        * Welcome to the USC was split into two cutscenes. The first "Welcome to the USC" part now plays before the title screen, and the second half (now named "Fast Cars Underground 2") plays before the Super Freaks Story as their first cutscene.
        * Gratituous Multiverse Cameos has been entirely redone, with the only things kept being some of the art and the general idea of the cutscene. The new one is way funnier and, more importantly, half as long!
        * If you really missed the old versions of these cutscenes for whatever reason, they're actually still available in the museum. No lost media here!
    * Even more new and updated music tracks! (thanks phil)
        * Toy Block Secret and Moon Secret have brand new themes
        * Several tracks, mostly in the first half, have been touched up, most notably Toy Block Bridge, Barrel Canyon Cliffs, and Barrel Secret
    * Static Menu Background visual option upgraded into Motion Sickness Mode
    * Title Screen logo cleaned up (thanks again Jordan)
    * Manual is now a markdown file instead of a word document (oops), patch notes are their own markdown file
* V3.1 - August 24th, 2025
    * Gameplay Changes (some of these are huge so pay attention)
        * Movement speed increased by 0.25px so you're not so sluggish
        * Sprinting: run uninterrupted and you'll notice your speed continue to increase. You'll see your character start to kick up dust clouds when you're going quickly enough for you to notice.
        * Turbo Mode: A new mode that can be chosen right from the level select screen! Your movement speed is much faster (4.25px vs 3.25), but you have only 30 seconds to make it to the end of the level, and you get one life, so no checkpoints. Extend your time by grabbing yorbs, beating enemies, hitting checkpoints, and collecting trophies. When you get hit, you'll lose 5 seconds, and this number increases by an extra 5 seconds every consecutive time you get hit. Make good use of your extra speed to dominate the level!
        * To accomodate the above changes and better the game's flow and difficulty in general, every level and boss has been touched up and rebalanced, some more drastically than others. A huge shoutout to Mugen Azure for playtesting every single level and boss very extensively. I fear her power.
    * Bug Fixes
        * Fast Forward is no longer jittery! That one was annoying me for two years. I had to rewrite the frame backend to make this happen.
        * Side effect of the above: Skizzorpede enemies are recoded from scratch and look much smoother AND actually explode into pieces when you kill them in Bad Guys Story. How awesome is that??? Woah!!!
    * Other
        * [New mod page at ModDB!](https://www.moddb.com/games/super-freaks-1-ultimate-edition) Hopefully this one won't randomly get taken down for no reason.
* V3.1.1 - August 31st, 2025
    * Gameplay Changes
        * In Turbo, when you get hit, the clock will visibly shake and show you how much time you just lost. You can't lose any extra time while it's draining like this, so you shouldn't get combo'd quite as badly in multiplayer, as a nice side effect of this.
        * Star Arrows will make you invincible while launching from them.
        * Fusedroppers visibly puff up a bit before dropping their explosive payload.
        * Boneblasters (the huge Doom revenant like guys in Conveyor Castle) will take the same amount of time to fire a missile regardless if Fast Forward is enabled. They were admittedly a little cheap with Fast Forward on!
    * Other
        * Recolored the Main Menu background--should look better than it did before but I'm willing to change it again!
        * The title screen now says TUURRRRBOOOOOOOOOOOOO, lovingly provided by defnotreal_.
