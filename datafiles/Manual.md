# Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition - Manual
## About
Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition is a remake of Super Freaks 1, a 2006 Game Maker 6 game. I remastered it in 2016 and gradually added more polish in the years since mostly for practice. Originally, Ultimate Edition was just going to be a port to Game Maker Studio 2 (which is why the graphics are still kind of ugly), but of course it ballooned out of control and evolved into a much more modern platformer, blending in elements from New Super Mario Bros. U, Sonic, Donkey Kong Country, and Crash Bandicoot into something that doesn’t feel quite like any of them. It’s definitely a lot better than the original version of the game!

## Story
Alright, let’s see what kind of shoe-string premise this dumb game has:

In the United States of Craziness, everything is chill thanks to Unlimit Energy, a magic energy source that lets anyone who has it warp reality. One fateful day, however, everything went wrong in the happy-go-lucky galaxy when all of the Unlimit Energy was stolen! Kranion, ever prideful, grew sick of being clowned on in Fast Cars Underground 2. Rather than admit he sucks at the game, he rounded up his army of Kranibots that he has for some reason and went on a galaxy wide looting spree!

Yet, there is hope. In a stadium on the floating Mystic Island live the Super Freaks, four half-brothers who always beat Kranion and other villains by using Unlimit Energy and Unlimit Powers. Unfortunately, no Unlimit Energy means the Super Freaks are denied their greatest weapon! The Super Freaks aren’t chumps though—they have several techniques they’ve honed over the years thanks to training with their Uncle Swordsman. Can they beat Kranion and take back the Unlimit Energy before he plunges the galaxy into mediocrity? …obviously yes! But they’re gonna need your platforming skills and dexterity to do it. Maybe bring a few buddies along with you too.

## Gameplay
Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition is a 2D platformer featuring single player and up to four player drop-in/drop-out cooperative gameplay.

Go to the right, jump on enemy heads, reach the exit, all of that standard stuff. When you select a level, you can choose between any of the Super Freaks before playing, as well as a whole host of other unlockable characters. There are over 20 characters total!

Also new to the game since version 1.1, custom characters can now be added via the “char” folder the game came with. We technically had a Gamebanana page for modding as well, unfortunately, Gamebanana sucks (for many reasons) and also they randomly took it down, and we’re not sure where else to host modded characters. For some reason you can still access the Gamebanana page and download some stuff, as well as view a tutorial: [Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition | SF1UE | Mods & Resources (gamebanana.com)](https://gamebanana.com/games/19289)

Every level can be played in one of three difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard) that changes the level layouts. You can also set three modifiers: a Mirror Mode, Fast Forward (speeds everything in the level up by 1.5x with a few exceptions to make it actually possible), and a Game Over screen so you too can suffer permadeath!

#### Story Modes
* ###### Super Freaks
	* In this adventure, the Super Freaks have to take down Kranion. The freaks share a heart meter on the bottom left of the screen; collecting yorbs will fill the meter, giving you a heart when it’s full. Collecting hearts and trophies will also give you extra hearts! You can also set the minimum amount of hearts you start with (upon death or starting a level) and the maximum amount of hearts you can have (default is 10, max is 99) before entering a level.
* ###### Bad Guys
	* This adventure takes place after the Super Freaks story, and it is recommended that you play it after. Kranion returns home to his castle and finds an imposter has taken it over, forcing him to team up with his eccentric brother Sticky. In this story, the characters all have ego meters that gradually drop to (or raise to if below it) 25%. Getting hit will lower the meter and send you closer to death, but filling it all the way with yorbs, hearts, and trophies will make you temporarily invincible!
* ###### Uncle Swordsman
	* After the Super Freaks, Kranion, and Sticky go on vacation, Uncle Swordsman and the One Eyed Bandit are forced to do battle with the evil skeletons’ father, Marrow Prime. Uncle Swordsman and the Bandit can build up an aura by grabbing yorbs and other collectibles; the higher your aura, the faster you run and the higher you jump, but you’ll lose it all when hit!

Compared to other platformers, the Super Freaks have a few extra tricks up their hypothetical sleeves, so let’s go over those:

#### Moves
* ###### Jump Ball
	* In an attempt to emulate Uncle Swordsman’s blade, the Super Freaks pioneered a spinning jump attack. Jumping at all will curl the player into a ball, which spins so fast that it’s surrounded by an energy field. This will let the player attack enemies at any angle. If an enemy is big enough, the player will bounce off of it. Luckily, you can curl back up by pressing the jump button in midair.
* ###### Wall Jump
	* You can also wall jump! Hold against a wall in the air to begin sliding against it. Jump again while doing so to jump away from the wall. You can keep jumping between two walls in rapid succession to climb up them.
* ###### Climbing
	* You might come across some Climbing Fences in your not really epic journey. When touching a Climbing Fence, press the up button to grab onto the fence. You can climb around in eight directions while grabbing on a fence, and you can let go at any time by jumping off. Be careful though! Some Climbing Fences will begin to move or even fall when you grab on.
	* You can also climb on poles! Press left/right to flip to the other side of the pole.
	* Hooks are another thing you can hang off of. You can simply jump and land on a hook to begin hanging from it. You can either jump off or press down to fall off, both of which will come in handy.
* ###### Bubble
	* In cooperative play, joining the game mid-level or pressing the bubble button will place you inside a bubble. When in a bubble, you’ll bounce around the screen, but you can hold the jump button to move towards another player. The other players will need to pop your bubble to free you. This move is useful if there’s a difficult section you know you can’t do but the other player can! It’s also useful for saving yourself from a bottomless pit at the last minute. Just don’t all of you bubble at the same time!
* ###### Elastiband
	* Pressing the Elastiband button will turn on/off your Elastiband. If more than one players have them active, you’ll be connected to each other by what is basically a big rubber band, like in Knuckles Chaotix. You can yank each other around with the Elastiband, which is good if one of you is falling behind in any way.
	* You can also change the color of your Elastiband between two separate colors, and you will only connect to people with the same color Elastiband.
	* If one of you is dangling in the air below your buddies, you can also hold the down button to lower yourself. Letting go will slingshot you straight up in the air so you can join your friend. Be careful not to dangle too low, or you’ll fall off the bottom of the screen!
* ###### Pausing
	* Pressing the pause button…pauses the game! What a concept! There are a few things you can do here though, so it’s actually worth me going into detail. You can choose to restart the level, go back to the last checkpoint you hit (a must if you’re grinding for trophies), or exit the level.
	* There is also a multiplayer option, which depends on which player paused the game. Player 1 will have a “kick players” option and can choose to kick players 2-4 for whatever reason. Players 2-4 on the other hand will have a “drop out” option instead and can drop out of play this way.

#### Collectibles
###### Yorb
The “coin” of this game, a glass orb that contains Unlimit Energy. Collecting 100 Yorbs will give you an extra heart!

###### Happy Heart
Collecting this heart with little rosy cheeks will, you guessed it, give you another heart. You can choose to start each level (and retry) with a minimum amount of hearts if you so choose, and there is a maximum value that by default is 10—you can either raise it all the way up to 99, or if you’re a total sadist, you can lower it all the way to zero to disable hearts entirely. Have fun…

###### Yorb Star
If you die enough times, a Yorb Star will appear right where you spawn. Collecting it will give you 10 hearts, unless you somehow already have that many! The death counter will reset by the time you reach the next checkpoint. This item only appears in Adventure Mode, and only when the Min/Max heart settings are between 1-10.

###### Trophy
Most levels (excluding boss levels) have three trophies to collect. These unlock a lot of different things: secret levels, extra characters, so on and so forth. You’ll also get a heart by collecting a trophy, which adds a little risk/reward strategy to them.

###### Uncle Swordsman’s Walkie Talkies
Not really a collectible. The Super Freaks’ Uncle Swordsman has been shoved in a locker by Kranion, but he’s still able to dispense his infinite wisdom with his walkie talkies. Just jump at one to receive his great advice.

###### Clock Stopper
Collecting this watch slows down time temporarily, which is seriously way cooler looking than I describe it here.

###### Number Stars
Green Stars with numbers on them. Collect them all in order from 1 to…whichever the last one is, and you’ll get a prize, usually a trophy! But if you grab just one out of order, they’ll disappear.

###### Time Stars
When you collect one Time Star, the rest will begin ticking down. Collect them all before they disappear, and you’ll get a prize! …which is again, usually a trophy.

###### Ray
Not actually a collectible. Ray the TV and his identical brothers act as checkpoints. You have infinite lives, but don’t be afraid to touch one of them so you don’t have to repeat that one level section again.

###### Skull Jar
Also not really a collectible. Kranion’s Kranibots shove their collected Unlimit Energy inside of a Skull Jar at the end of each level. By touching it, it will explode and you’ll beat the level, as well as denying Kranion some more power.

## Modes
There are a variety of game modes which are pretty dope if you ask me.

* #### Adventure
	* This is the main story mode. Cutscenes will play before and after some levels, which you can fast forward through and/or skip if you don’t like sitting through the stupidest video game storyline you’ve ever seen.
* #### Challenge
	* There are several challenge modes which you’ll unlock as you progress through the game and get trophies:
	* ###### Free Play
		* You can replay any level you’ve completed without cutscenes or anything. Good for quick plays and practice! You can still grab trophies here to unlock things.
	* ###### Randomizer
		* An endless survival mode. Here, every level you’ve beaten is thrown at you in random order. You can also only collect up to four hearts at a time.
	* ###### Speedrun
		* You must beat several levels back-to-back as fast as possible. At the end, you’ll see your time. There is a total of 10 (!!) speedrun modes; one for each world in the game (unlocked by beating every level including the secret level in that world), one containing every main story level, one containing every secret level, and one featuring every level in the game.
	* ###### Boss Rush
		* The good old boss rush: fight every boss in a row. Your hearts stack between fights, but you can game over here, so don’t slip up!
* #### Museum
	* You can view some stuff you encounter in the main game here:
	* ###### Character Cards
		* Any character you meet in the game will have a bio appear in this mode. You can read all about that character. This saves me from having to exposition dump during the cutscenes!
	* ###### Movie Theater
		* Wanna watch the X-Freaks get beat up in seconds again? Any cutscene you view in the Adventure mode will appear here for repeated viewing. You can also see the credits!

## Options
I’ve added a number of option settings you can fiddle with to make this game a better experience. Let’s go over them!

* #### Controls
	* In this menu you can remap every action in the game, to your liking, be it for keyboard or gamepad. You can bind multiple buttons to one action too! Simply select an action, and then press the desired keyboard key or gamepad button (on the selected player’s controller) to either add or remove it from the selected action.
* #### Visuals
	* There are quite a number of settings here, some of which are pretty dope. 
	* **Resolution:** You can set the screen resolution all the way from 16:9 (the default) to 4:3 (the original game’s resolution) to 21:10! That’s right, ultrawide!
	* **Window Upscale Size:** You can set the size of the window from 1x to 4x. I believe it runs faster the smaller the window is, but don’t quote me on that.
	* **Internal Upscale Size:** This will blow up the internal resolution, which mostly affects how the game looks when the camera is zoomed out. 2x is the default setting—you’re probably better off leaving it that way.
	* **Fullscreen:** Set the game to fullscreen, or not. It’s Windows Exclusive Fullscreen, if that makes any difference. I’ve found the game to run a bit more efficiently with it on.
	* **Vsync:** You can turn on vsync, which might help with your framerate. I finally got it working, can you believe that?
	* **Framerate:** Now this is one of my favorite things. Because of the way I coded the game (with a semi-fixed timestep, if you have any idea what that is), the game logic always runs at 60fps, even when the window doesn’t. That means I can lerp the graphics in-between frames. You can set the framerate to 30, 60, 90, 120, 144, 165, 240, and even unlocked, and naturally the higher framerates look butter smooth. Not bad for a silly little platformer!
	* **Screen Shake:** You can disable screen shake if you want to. I saw a bunch of other games include this as an accessibility setting, so I figured, why not?
	* **Background Blur:** If you so choose, you can blur the background. It might make it easier to tell the foreground and background apart if I did a bad job at doing that myself. 
	* **Screen Shader:** This is a fun little feature; you can enable wacky screen shaders for fun! Sadly I have only one currently: Justice is Gray, which makes the screen monochrome. This was based on an April Fools joke where I added this setting to Super Freaks 1 Remastered when the Snyder Cut was released.
* #### Audio
	* Currently I only have two options here, both for setting music and sound effect volumes. I know it’s unexciting but hey, they’re practical! No idea why you’d want to turn the music down though. I mean have you listened to it? It’s GOOD.
